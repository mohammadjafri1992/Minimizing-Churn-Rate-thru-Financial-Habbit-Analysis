# Minimizing Churn Rate through Financial Habbit Analysis

This project analyzes financial behavior of users and estimates whether someone will chrun (leave our product/app) or not.

One major drawback of our project was that this analysis was performed on the assumption that if someone leaves the product, they would leave it, of if someone stays with the product, they stay forever.

This flaw was discovered after performing Exploratory Data Analysis on our dataset when I discovered no mention of time frame as a feature.
